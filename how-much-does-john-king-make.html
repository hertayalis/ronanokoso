He spent hours on-air, almost nonstop, from the time coverage began, well into the early hours of the morning the following day. And people took notice.</p><p>Even for those who have never closely followed politics or even watched the news, seeing King in action with his ‚Äúmagic wall‚Äù of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">election results</a> impressed them. So much so that Twitter went a bit wild commending the longtime news anchor for his stamina in staying awake and on his feet for so long. And, as to be expected, they have questions about who he is and if CNN is paying the guy what he‚Äôs worth.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CNN</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How much does John King make?</h2><p>King has been a journalist and TV news anchor for decades. And, while he began the major points of his career as a writer for the Associated Press, he joined CNN in 1997. From there, he rose through the ranks as a chief correspondent for the White House and the United States as a whole. Because of his experience with the network and as an anchor, King‚Äôs yearly salary is very likely in the millions.</p><p>According to CNN, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on-air anchors</a> can earn anywhere from five figures into the millions, depending on experience. Given King‚Äôs experience and number of years with CNN, he likely makes more than $1 million for his yearly salary. Fox News‚Äô Sean Hannity makes $40 million and Robin Roberts makes $18 million as a co-host of Good Morning America, so King is more than likely sitting pretty on CNN.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>John King is flawless. Literally. His knowledge is unmatched. He is fair and his poise puts viewers at ease.</p><p>We forever remember who delivers the news at historic times like these, we‚Äôre lucky that it‚Äôs John.</p>‚Äî Taylor Rooks (@TaylorRooks) <a href=#>November 4, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">John King's net worth is pretty impressive.</h2><p>With King‚Äôs salary likely in the millions, it's no wonder that, according to Celebrity Net Worth, his overall <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth is $7 million</a>. Though to be fair, it wouldn't be surprising if it was even higher than that. And King‚Äôs coverage on CNN goes well beyond the election. He has also guided Americans through the COVID-19 pandemic as well as politics in general.</p><p>But, he told the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being on television</a> wasn't always his plan.</p><p>"I had no interest in being in television," King said. "I had worked for the Associated Press for 12 years. I started in Rhode Island. I came to Boston. Talk about luck: &nbsp;We had a great guy, Chris Daley, who was running our State House bureau at the time; he was a fabulous reporter who didn't want to go to Iowa, didn't want to go to New Hampshire‚Ä¶ So they looked around and said, ‚ÄòAll right, kid, how about you?‚Äô I was 23 years old. I was pretty cool."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anderson Cooper and the CNN crew carrying John King out of the studio after the election is over and he can finally stop standing by his big board <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QboFk7k5Gy</a></p>‚Äî j√∏nathan‚Ñ¢ü¶ë (@J_Overstreet14) <a href=#>November 4, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is John King's ex-wife?</h2><p>Somewhere along the way in his busy career, King was married twice and had three kids. And his ex-wife, Dana Bash, is a fellow CNN anchor and correspondent. After just four years of marriage, they divorced in 2012. Together, they had one child and, as it stands, King has three kids total.</p><p>So when he‚Äôs not busy on his feet all day and night trying to keep America in the know, King is likely busy with them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyumqFllKSytHnJqJ%2BnZZueu6h5zJqing%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./motorola-xoom-review-first-honeycomb-tablet-arrives.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Multitasking, Notifications and App Launcher</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gregory-isaacs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Gregory Isaacs</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-craig-and-paige-still-together-2023.html>Are Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo Still Together in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeffree-star-and-nathan-back-together.html>Are Jeffree Star and Nathan Back Together?
