Fans of the show were very upset to see her eliminated and not a part of the <a href=#>top 26</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But, in an unexpected turn of events, Paige was able to rejoin the competition. Did someone from the original Top 26 drop out? Who was it?

But contestant <a href=#>Beckett Rex dropped out</a>. More on that in a moment. First, Paige has talked about her second chance and how grateful she is.</p><p>She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said that</a>, "I just feel like I have an amazing opportunity to be able to share my talent on an amazing platform, and I’m just really excited to be able to do that and hopefully make it farther."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Paige also revealed that she actually gets nervous before performing.</p><p>“I am one that is really self-conscious and always in my head and really hard on myself, and so I really just try and breathe and distract myself before I go on stage to go sing," she confided. "As soon as I get on stage, and I make that connection with the people and the audience, it’s just a changing factor. It makes it easy for me to perform. Singing is the easiest part. It’s just walking on to that stage that is hard.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Incidentally, even though second chances are unlikely on the show, Paige isn't the only person who has gotten one this season. <a href=#>Fire Wilmore</a>, who was denied in her first audition, was asked to come back and audition again in the same season. She got in the second time — but was ultimately eliminated.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Beckett Rex leave 'American Idol'?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He said that, "I'm not going to say why I didn't decide to continue in the competition but what I will say is that it was my choice. I am forever grateful to my American Idol family and I will always look back at the experience with the utmost gratitude and fondness. Please go vote for my friends now as they continue on in the competition."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The singer announced on his Instagram a few days ago that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his grandfather recently passed away</a>.
