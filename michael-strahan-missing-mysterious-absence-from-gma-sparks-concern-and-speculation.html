Whispers among the staff and fans alike repeat worries and inquiries, but there is a noticeable emptiness. The quiet remains throughout time, leaving the stage seemingly unfinished.</p><p>A mist of mystery surrounds the cause, producing tangible expectations for the reappearance of a familiar face. Well-wishes and encouraging messages pour in, enclosing the absence in a web of care and concern and intensifying the mystery surrounding the mysterious leaving.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Michael Strahan’s Absence</strong></h2><p><a href=# data-type=post_tag data-id=145>Michael Strahan</a>, Good Morning America’s co-host, has been noticeably absent from the broadcast, causing worries among fans.
