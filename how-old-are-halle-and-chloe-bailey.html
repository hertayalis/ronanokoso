Halle, along with her older sister Chloe Bailey, have been flexing their vocals professionally since they were 11 and 13 years old, respectively. The talented duo even acted side by side in Grown-ish and made cameos in Austin & Ally. Their similar appearance and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">intertwined professional careers</a> have led some fans to believe that the sisters are twins. But how old are the Baileys?</p>Recommended Videos<h2 data-injectable=false>How old is Chloe Bailey?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=571 data-current-count=871 data-injectable=true><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chloe Bailey</a> </strong>is the second of four children. She was born on July 1, 1998. Though the Bailey sisters started their careers together – the pair launched a YouTube channel when Chloe was 13 – they have found success working independently. Since her early days appearing as herself alongside her sister in various Disney shows and as musical guests, the elder Bailey sister has been branching into alternative and horror projects. Meanwhile, her solo career as Chlöe <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has been well-received</a> by critics, and the American artist Beyoncé has taken her under her wing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-how-old-is-halle-bailey data-injectable=false>How old is Halle Bailey?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=785 data-current-count=1085 data-injectable=false>The third of four children, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Halle Bailey</a> is around two years younger than her sister. She was born on March 27, 2000, and started acting at three years old alongside Chloe. The duo <a href=#>found success singing</a> as Chloe X Halle on YouTube and had their first viral moment after releasing a cover of Beyoncé’s “Best Thing I Never Had.” Their virality jettisoned the pair to national fame, landing them slots on The Ellen Show and Radio Disney’s Next Big Thing. Since her 2023 appearance as Ariel in The Little Mermaid, the actress has focused on a solo career and is taking a step into the world of drama with The Color Purple. Not to worry, the film is a reimagining Broadway musical based on the film of the same name, so fans will still get to hear Bailey’s<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> incredible vocals</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8eormannJl6or7EZp%2BapJyaeqK6w2aaoaSfmnqjrcilnLJn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./j-robert-oppenheimer-net-worth-59341.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>J.
