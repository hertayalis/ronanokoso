She said that all the time. It made me a fighter.”</p><p class=story-text data-index=5>Akers drew inspiration from his mother’s battle. She gave him some advice before meeting with NFL teams, including the Falcons, at the scouting combine. The draft is set to be held April 23-25.</p><p class=story-text data-index=6><b>» MORE:</b>&nbsp;<a href=#>Top running backs in NFL Draft</a></p><p class=story-text data-index=7>“She just told me to be me,” Akers said. “Be confident, know who I am and just stand on that. Be the young man that I am and be confident with that.”</p><p class=story-text data-index=8>After breaking Dalvin Cook’s FSU freshman rushing record, things got a little bumpy at Florida State and the eventual firing of coach Willie Taggart.</p><p class=story-text data-index=10>“I say it’s all God’s plan,” Akers said. “You can’t question it. You play the cards you’re dealt. When you start to question God, that’s when the situation you’re in becomes a reality. I never question God. I always stay true to my faith. I keep working.”</p><p class=story-text data-index=12>Akers showed his versatility for the Seminoles and patterns his game after two NFL double-threat running backs.</p><p class=story-text data-index=13>“I definitely watch Zeke (Elliott of the Cowboys) as far as an all-around back, being able to catch, run and block,” Akers said. “And (Saints running back) Alvin Kamara definitely in the passing game, the way he’s elusive when he gets the ball in his hands.”</p><p class=story-text data-index=14>Akers doesn’t shy away from blocking.</p><p class=story-text data-index=15>“You can’t play in this league if you can’t block, and I learned that early in college,” Akers said. “I have a good understanding of that and I know that’s something I’ve got to be sharp on.</p><p class=story-text data-index=16>Most have Akers as the third rated running back behind Wisconsin’s Jonathan Taylor and Georgia’s D’Andre Swift.</p><p class=story-text data-index=19>“He's talented,” NFL Network draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah said. “I've got him&nbsp;— I broke down the running backs and … I had them in different tiers. He's in my second tier. I had Swift, (LSU’s Clyde) Edwards-Helaire and (Ohio State’s J.K.) Dobbins in my top tier.”</p><p class=story-text data-index=20>Jeremiah is not as high on Taylor, who ran the 40-yard dash in 4.39 seconds at the combine.</p><p class=story-text data-index=21>“And I have Taylor and Akers just right below that,” Jeremiah said. “He runs really hard.”</p><p class=story-text data-index=22>Akers was able to shine through the tough times at Florida State.</p><p class=story-text data-index=23>“They just weren’t any good. Florida State wasn’t any good,” Jeremiah said. “And sometimes when you’re a player that’s on a team and a program that’s in a place that that program was at last year, he had all the reason in the world to shut it down and he didn’t do it, which told me a lot about him as a competitive kid. I think teams like him as well. I think he’s a really good football player.”</p><p class=story-text data-index=25>ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper ranks Swift as the top running back in the draft.</p><p class=story-text data-index=26>“It’s the completeness as a runner, receiver, blocker and ball security,” Kiper said. “(In) all four areas, he comes out on top ahead of J.K. Dobbins and Jonathan Taylor. Now, Dobbins is a fierce runner. I think he’s the best pure runner. He and Jonathan Taylor are the two best pure runners. When we go to hands, Swift gets the edge over both.”</p><p class=story-text data-index=27>Taylor must improve his ball security.</p><p class=story-text data-index=28>“Eighteen fumbles, 15 lost at Wisconsin, that’s a concern,” Kiper said. “He lost a fumble against Oregon in the Rose Bowl. … He dropped a swing pass in that game as well.”</p><p class=story-text data-index=29>Kiper projects that Swift could go as high as 14th to Tampa Bay or could go to Miami, who holds the 18th and 26th picks in the first round.</p><p class=story-text data-index=31>“Then guess what, the problem is, if you don’t go to Tampa or Miami, what other team is going to prioritize running back to take a D’Andre Swift if Tampa or Miami don’t,” Kiper said. “That’s the tough part. You know Swift is one of the best 20 players in this draft … it’s just finding a fit for a running back when most teams are well fortified at that position (that is difficult).”</p><p class=story-text data-index=33>--</p><p class=story-text data-index=34><b>The Bow Tie Chronicles Podcasts:</b></p><p class=story-text data-index=35>Can be found on Google, iTunes and TuneIn</p><p class=story-text data-index=37>For more content about the&nbsp;<b><a href=#>Atlanta Falcons</a>:</b></p><p class=story-text data-index=38>Follow me on Twitter&nbsp;<b><a href=#>@DorlandoAJC</a></b></p><p class=story-text data-index=39>On Facebook at&nbsp;<b><a href=#>Atlanta Falcons News Now</a></b></p><p class=story-text data-index=40>Atlanta Falcons coverage on the&nbsp;<b><a href=#>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a></b></p><p class=story-text data-index=41>Have a question?
