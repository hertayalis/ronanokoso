Carvana should also be notified and all pertinent documents should be gathered.</p><p>Depending on the situation, it may be a good idea to lawyer up. If pulled over driving a Carvana car (or any car) without a title or matching VINs, or one that's been stolen, it definitely won't be just a slap on the wrist.
