One line in particular, “Cause we’ll put a boot in your ass/ It’s the American way” drew criticism from more liberal listeners.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>A vocal opponent of then-President Bush and the war on Iraq, Maines disliked the lyrics and called them ignorant, saying, “it makes country music sound ignorant. It targets an entire culture — and not just the bad people who did bad things. You’ve got to have some tact.”</p><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=773 data-injectable=true>Keith took umbrage with her response, calling her a “big mouth” for her comments. He began displaying fake images of Maines alongside images of Saddam Hussain at his concerts. In turn, Maines wore a homemade t-shirt with the acronym “F.U.T.K.” emblazoned on it. Though the women initially claimed the letters stood for “Friend United in Truth and Kindness,” Maines eventually came clean in the band’s documentary, Shut Up and Sing that the letters did in fact refer to Toby Keith.</p><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>In March of 2003, The Chicks <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">were all but exiled </a>from the country music scene after Maines told British audiences, “Just so you know, we’re on the good side with y’all. We do not want this war, this violence, and we’re ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas.” The controversy surrounding the statement followed The Chicks for years, but the band stood by their comments.</p><h2 id=h-toby-keith-ends-the-feud data-injectable=false>Toby Keith ends the feud</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>While the band struggled with a near industry wide blackout of their music, Toby Keith had his own moment of reckoning. In August of that year, Keith ended the spat after news that a good friend of his had a young daughter who was dying of cancer. When Keith heard the news that the 2-year-old wasn’t long for this world, it made him take stock of his life. He told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Contactmusic</a>,</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>“I saw a picture on the cover of&nbsp;Country Weekly&nbsp;with a picture of me and Natalie and it said, ‘Fight to the Death’ or something. It seemed so insignificant. I said, ‘Enough is enough.’” He went on to say that he never started the spat, “They started it with me; they came out and just tore me up.”</p><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=false>Toby Keith lost his own fight with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stomach cancer</a> after a 6-month battle with the disease.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZZKawbixxKdkraCVYrGqxMieZJygmZi4tHnAp5tmrJ%2BXxm63xKKroWWknbJur86nq6unppq%2FtMWMnq%2BppJGeu6awjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-marysol-castro-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Marysol Castro Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tim-henmans-ultra-private-4m-home-with-wife-daughters-and-multiple-pets.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tim Henman's ultra-private 4.9m home with wife, daughters and multiple pets</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-craig-and-paige-still-together-2023.html>Are Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo Still Together in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeffree-star-and-nathan-back-together.html>Are Jeffree Star and Nathan Back Together?
