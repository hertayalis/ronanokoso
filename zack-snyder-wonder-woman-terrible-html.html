Suffice it to say, the idea is not good, and even the most die-hard Snyder fans would have a hard time defending it. Essentially, the idea boiled down to Wonder Woman’s father, Zeus, being a Kryptonian like <a href=#>Superman</a>, which would explain where she gained her powers.</p><p><a href=#>The Direct</a> reported on some of Zack Synder’s Wonder Woman comments, where he said, “It’s this whole thing with Ares and Zeus… [We considered how] Zeus could possibly be a Kryptonian,” adding, “So, that Wonder Woman’s powers…you can sort of see where that’s going.” Even with Synder himself explaining it, the idea seems pretty half-baked at best. Thankfully, studio intervention actually ended up being beneficial for once, and Warner Bros execs shot the idea down.</p><p>In Zack Snyder’s Wonder Woman plans Ares would have factored into the Kryptonian equation, too, with him being the one to crash the Kryptonian scout ship in Man of Steel. This also terrible tidbit was revealed by Snyder’s VFX supervisor John DesJardin who explained, “And Ares was the one who caused the scout ship to crash to be in the ice… He killed his crew.” So, not only would this take away from Wonder Woman’s origin story, but it would detract from <a class=wpil_keyword_link title=Superman data-wpil-keyword-link=linked href=# rel=noopener>Superman</a>‘s as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/wonder-woman-themiscyra-1-900x540.png><p>In Zack Snyder’s vision for Wonder Woman, we would have a totally different character from the one we know in the comics. In almost every iteration, Diana Prince is born on the island of Themyscira&nbsp;and raised by the Amazons, including her mother Hippolyta. Fans are sticklers for origin stories, and there really wouldn’t be any good reason to mess with this one, especially since Wonder Woman is such a well-known character.</p><p>Following <a href=#>James Gunn</a> and Peter Safran’s takeover of the DCU, many fans bemoaned the loss of the Snyderverse DCEU. Hearing Zack Snyder’s plans for Wonder Woman might make some of these fans rethink their stance and quiet down some of the demands to bring back the Snyderverse. Although we have Snyder to thank for first introducing Wonder Woman to the DCEU in <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Batman data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Batman</a> vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, it seems like he could have potentially taken the character off the rails pretty quickly.</p><p>It appears pretty clear that James Gunn won’t be letting Zack Snyder anywhere near Wonder Woman in his new DCU, but we still don’t know for sure if Gal Gadot will continue to reprise her role. While we know that production on Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman 3 was taken off the schedule, there has been no official axing of major Snyder-era characters other than <a class=wpil_keyword_link title="Henry Cavill" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked href=# rel=noopener>Henry Cavill</a>‘s Superman. We’ll still see <a href=#>Jason Momoa’s</a> Aquaman, Ezra Miller’s Flash, and even Ben Affleck’s Batman in upcoming films.</p><p>We did see Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman make a cameo in <a class=wpil_keyword_link title=Shazam data-wpil-keyword-link=linked href=# rel=noopener>Shazam</a>! Fury of the Gods, but that’s not necessarily indicative that she will have a future in the DCU. And while Gunn could theoretically let Zack Snyder continue to build his Snyderverse under the <a href=#>DC Elseworlds</a> banner, the major shakeup and the desire to separate the new films from the critical failures of the Snyderverse make this seem pretty unlikely. In any case, we’ll keep you updated on any new developments on the DCU.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iykZi4br%2FNspueql2svK%2BwxKtksKedlrtuwMSrqaKanJp7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./costco-luxardo-cherries-deal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Costco is Selling One of Giada De Laurentiis' Go-To Cocktail Add-Ins</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-did-eagles-change-their-logo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Did the Eagles Change Their Logo?
