After announcing their engagement — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and soon after, their wedding</a> — in early 2023, the duo announced their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">impending divorce in mid-November</a>. The culprit behind their split could be any number of things, from their quick engagement to their age gap, and anything in between.</p><p data-characters=624 data-current-count=1022 data-injectable=true>Regardless of the “why” behind their divorce, Appleton and Gage will both be single in a matter of months, at most. With such a short marriage, its entirely possible the pair will be officially unwed within a few weeks, particularly with the kind of financial weight they can throw around. Both Appleton and Gage are worth a fair bit of cash, and everyone knows money talks. It’s likely to make the process itself a fair bit easier, but the wealthier half of the couple could be eyeing down a serious impact on their finances. Divorce is expensive, after all, particularly when you’re worth millions.</p><h2 id=h-lukas-gage-s-2023-net-worth-explained data-injectable=false>Lukas Gage’s 2023 net worth, explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lukas-Gage-net-worth.jpg><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>There’s a 12-year age gap between Gage and Appleton, so its fair to assume that Appleton makes a bit more money than his younger former spouse. That’s not actually the case, however, based on an examination of each man’s net worth.</p><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>Estimates place both Appleton and Gage’s net worths in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">same general range</a>. Appleton’s bank account is likely resting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">somewhere between $2 and $5 million</a>, according to various sources, and Gage is credited with a similar number. His earning potential most certainly outpaces Appleton’s — thanks to his involvement in several major projects, including White Lotus and Euphoria — but, as of now, he’s likewise sitting pretty on a net worth <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">between $2</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$5 million</a>.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>That should see both halves of the short-lived marriage walk away with their assets relatively intact, since neither vastly out-earns the other. That, paired with the prenuptial agreement they both signed, should lessen the financial burden of divorce. That’s one small boon in a bad situation, and might just help the process pass nice and smooth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZyquKK%2FjKCYoJ2jYrumwIywpqusmGK2r3mRaWlsZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dredge-update-3-patch-notes-a-painter-shipwrecks-and-craberrations.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Painter, Shipwrecks, and Craberrations</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-tendencies-by-hollywood-undead.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Meaning Behind The Song: Tendencies by Hollywood Undead</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-craig-and-paige-still-together-2023.html>Are Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo Still Together in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeffree-star-and-nathan-back-together.html>Are Jeffree Star and Nathan Back Together?
