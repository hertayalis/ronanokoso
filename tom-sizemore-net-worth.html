Tom Sizemore suffered a Brain Aneurysm at the age of 61 years. Through his Manager, Charles Lago, Tom Sizemore’s life is on the line as he reported that “there is nothing more to be done”.</p><p>Tom Sizemore’s health has deteriorated and the hard decision of euthanizing him is on the table. It is from this that the topic of his Net Worth stems as his family asked the public for space as ‘they decide the end of life matters.’</p><p>As unfortunate as it is, Tom Sizemore’s health is arguable a result of his lifestyle choices. The renowned Actor is publicly known to be a struggling addict of narcotic drugs. He has been placed in an induced coma.</p><p><strong>Also Read: -&nbsp;<a href=#>Kyle Dubas Net Worth</a></strong></p><h3><strong>Tom Sizemore Addiction</strong></h3><p>Tom Sizemore appeared as himself in the 2009-2010 television show on Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew and Celebrity Rehab Presents Sober House. In this show, the Actor is seen undergoing the processes in Rehab. He admitted to being addicted to Heroin and Crystal Meth.</p><p>In his autobiography, ‘Some Miracle I Made It Out’ Tom Sizemore describes his introduction to drugs and explains his experience with drugs. His substance abuse problems date back to the early 2000s.</p><p>He has attributed his addiction to his troubled and failed relationships with his ex-wives. The journey to his sobriety sees him remorseful for his behavior as he recovered from his anger management issues.</p><h3><strong>Tom Sizemore Career</strong></h3><p><strong><img alt="Tom Sizemore Net Worth" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/savedaughters.com/public/ckimages/ck_1677667220.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></strong></p><p>The Actor has had an exceptional career as an Actor. Tom Sizemore joined the Industry in the late 80s making his mark in blockbuster movies for over 30 years. He has been nominated and awarded different titles for best actor and best supporting actor.

His first marriage was short-lived as he got divorced shortly after. Thereafter he got married a second time and got twice divorced in 1999. He has two progeny, aged 18 from his partner Janelle McIntire, who stand to inherit a share of his Net Worth.</p><p>Thomas Sizemore never married again after his two failed marriages but is known to have a lifetime partner in Janelle McIntire.
