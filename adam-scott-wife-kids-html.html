(2003) and The Andy Milonakis Show (2005-2006).</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>When speaking about working together, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Scott shared</a> the two weren’t sure at first because a good partnership at home doesn’t necessarily translate to a good partnership in work. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, they soon realized they were great at working together, as they shared much in common.</p><p>And even the things that they differed in helped their chemistry. Naomi gave an example of how Scott was creative and enjoyed things like acting and directing while she enjoyed things he didn’t like, like scheduling and crunching numbers.</p><p>Naomi joked she thought of working together because Scott was working so much, the only way to see him was to work together. She later shared how them being friends in their relationship helped them work together.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>“We’re really good friends in our marriage, which is like the lucky thing,” she said.</p><p>“If you’re gonna work this many hours, you wanna be surrounded by people who trust you can get this done.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Adam Scott and Spouse Have Two Kids</h2><p>Scott and his wife tied the knot in 2005 after eight years together.

He previously <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told Stephen Colbert</a> that his children refused to watch his shows, even when he suggested they watch Parks and Recreation. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“They love everything around it [Parks and Recreation]. They love The Office, and The Good Place, and Brooklyn Nine Nine,” he said.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>“They love everything around it, but they won’t do Parks and Rec just because I’m on it.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In another <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers</a>, he shared another story of how shocked his kids were when he popped up in The Good Place. “They saw me on it and they kind of looked at me like, ‘Woah!
