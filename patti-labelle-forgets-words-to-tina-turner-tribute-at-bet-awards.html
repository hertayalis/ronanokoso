Having the incomparable Ms. Patti LaBelle on our stage honoring one of her contemporaries was an equal privilege,” the spokesperson told the outlet.</p><p>“Due to the crowd’s enthusiasm, the teleprompter was obstructed, obscuring Ms. LaBelle’s view of the lyrics. Nonetheless, we couldn’t be more grateful to Ms. LaBelle for lending her incredible talent to this moment.”</p><p>But LaBelle didn’t let that stop her and powered through the song as the crowd danced and sang along to give her encouragement and a helpful hand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/NYPICHPDPICT000013222656.jpg><p>She even took the opportunity to joke about a previous performance of hers with a similar mishap.</p><p>“Where my background singers?” LaBelle quipped, referring to her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">performance of “This Christmas”</a> at the 1996 National Tree Lighting Ceremony, when the cue cards were out of order.</p><p>“God bless you, Tina Turner, BET, hip-hop!” she said at the end of the performance.</p><p>But watchers on Twitter knocked the number, suggesting that LaBelle must not have memorized the song and joking about Turner’s reaction from heaven.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>One person <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted a video</a> from the audience sharing that LaBelle couldn’t see the prompter with the lyrics because her section was standing in front of it.</p><p>“Patti LaBelle versus teleprompters… a decades long battle…,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one user tweeted</a>, calling back to her 1996 performance.</p><p>“Tina Turner in heaven right now after miss Patti LaBelle didn’t know her lyrics,” another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said with a video</a> of a woman being held back.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>“Ike Turner in hell watching Patti Labelle mess up the words,” someone wrote, mentioning Turner’s abusive ex-husband who died in 2007.</p><p>“Miss Patti no you didn’t y’all know damn well miss Patti needs to see them damn lyrics #BETAwards why you got Miss Patti out there looking like that she hitting them notes, but ain’t got them lyrics. We still love her though,” a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fan said</a>.</p><p>“Twitter is going to light up Patti LaBelle for that tribute to Tina Turner when they should bow down and shut their mouths. That woman is 79 years old and paved the way for just about every other singer in that room. Clearly she couldn’t see the words to the song, didn’t know the song and couldn’t hear the monitors to get the key,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another defended the singer</a>.</p><p>“Also, BET should have chosen for her to sing ‘What’s Love Got To Do With It’ or a song that she could’ve crushed, but to be cliche they picked ‘The Best.’ All of y’all should shut up and respect greatness. I’ve seen Patti about 100 times in concert and she crushes it every single time. Go slander your own selves who can’t carry a tune to save your lives and are watching on 43 inch TVs while she goes home to a house with a home theatre.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Turner <a href=#>died in May at the age of 83</a> from <a href=#>natural causes peacefully</a> in her home in Küsnacht, Switzerland, near&nbsp;<a href=#>Zurich</a>.
