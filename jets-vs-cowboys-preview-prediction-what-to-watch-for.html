Gardner was not happy with his performance after the game.</p><p>“It was average,” Gardner said. “I shouldn’t be allowing that many yards. That’s my standard. A lot of corners, that’s a good game. My standard and the coaches’ standard for me are different. The things that I want to accomplish, the legacy I want to have, it’s got to look different.”</p><p>Now, he will get a chance to bounce back against Lamb.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">CeeDee Lamb <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Though the Jets don’t have their cornerbacks travel, Gardner should see a good amount of Lamb, who caught four passes for 77 yards last Sunday against the Giants.</p><p>Head coach Robert Saleh said Gardner’s play was fine against the Bills.</p><p>He just ran into a tough receiver in Diggs.</p><p>“He’s a tough critic,” Saleh said of Gardner. “If five receptions, 62 yards put on him is a bad day, then we’re doing OK. But that’s why he’s special. That’s a bad day for him. The challenge for him is to stay deliberate, state focused, treat every rep like a championship moment and continue to find ways to get better.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Sauce Gardner <span class=credit>Bill Kostroun/New York Post</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Costello’s call</h2><p>No Rodgers, no chance.</p><p>Sorry to blow up <a href=#>all the Zach Wilson optimism</a>, but I don’t see how the Jets can win this game against a very good Cowboys defense.</p><p>The Jets’ defense should be able to keep them in the game into the second half before Dallas pulls away.</p><p>Cowboys 20, Jets 3</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Four downs</h2><p><strong>Micah the monster:</strong> Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons has established himself as one of the best defensive players in football in just his third season.</p><p>Parsons finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting last year and is a favorite to win the award this season.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Micah Parsons hits Daniel Jones during the Cowboy’s 40-0 Week 1 win over the Giants. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>He had a sack against the Giants last week and cleared the way for several of his teammates to sack Daniel Jones by absorbing double teams.</p><p>The Jets’ offensive line gave up three sacks to the Bills and were the worst team in the NFL in pass block win rate, according to ESPN. Parsons could be in Zach Wilson’s face frequently.</p><p>“He’s a game-wrecker,” Jets head coach Robert Saleh said. “From everything I’ve heard, he’s an unbelievable worker. On top of it, you have to game plan for the guy. On top of that, he just wrecks games. … He’s special. You have to be aware of where he is at all times. He’s as dynamic a football player as anybody in football.”</p><p><strong>Breeeeeece:</strong> Jets running back Breece Hall made his return on Monday night from the left ACL injury that ended his season in Week 7 a year ago.</p><p>Hall <a href=#>looked like his old self</a>.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Breece Hall <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>He broke off an 83-yard run, the second-longest in franchise history, and hit 20.54 mph on that play. The Jets held him back last week, but will increase his role slightly this week.</p><p>“You just try to give him a little bit more every single week,” Saleh said. “We’re still in the pitch-count world. We gave him 11 touches last week.”</p><p><strong>Feeling special:</strong> The Jets are going to need contributions from every area to win this game.</p><p>With Wilson back at quarterback, they can’t rely on their offense to carry the team.</p><p>Special teams could end up playing a huge role in this game. Kicker Greg Zuerlein injured his groin Thursday and will not be available.</p><p>That would be a huge loss, because Zuerlein has proven to be a reliable kicker.</p><p>He made three field goals Monday night.</p><p>The Jets also got a big contribution from punter Thomas Morstead last week, pinning the Bills inside their own 15 twice.</p><p>Punt returner Xavier Gipson made the biggest special teams play, breaking the winning 65-yard return in overtime.</p><p><strong>Rough road:</strong> The Jets lost their final five road games of the 2022 season after they won their first four.</p><p>They will try to get back on track at AT&T Stadium, where they won in 2015, the last time they played here.</p><p>They are 5-12 away from home in Saleh’s first two seasons as coach.</p><p>The Cowboys are 39-18 at home since 2016 when Dak Prescott became their quarterback.</p><p>Only the Chiefs, Packers and Ravens have posted better home winning percentages.</p><p>Overall, the Jets have a chance to start the season 2-0 for the first time since 2015.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jmam9fn7K1v4yvqmabn6yvsMXSZqernaaesrh5z6ucnaGTqbawuoywn5qsXam8bsPArZqhZZakv3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sam-smith-being-compared-to-walrus-in-new-bikini-pics-enrages-fans-reigniting-a-crucial-body-shaming-question.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sam Smith being compared to walrus in new bikini pics enrages fans, reigniting a crucial body-shamin</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pat-roberts-net-worth-225205.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pat Roberts Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-craig-and-paige-still-together-2023.html>Are Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo Still Together in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeffree-star-and-nathan-back-together.html>Are Jeffree Star and Nathan Back Together?
