As you might expect from a Darren Star production, the TV Land series is splashy, indulgent, and not the least bit realistic. After all, what mid-level editor can afford a wardrobe filled with Missoni and Proenza Schouler?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Suspension of disbelief aside, with such great fashion on the show, it's no surprise that the costumes have practically become characters all their own. From architecturally over-the-top necklaces worn by marketing exec Diana Trout (Miriam Shor) to the age-bending designer duds that Liza Miller (Sutton Foster) sports throughout the seven seasons, Younger has gifted audiences with countless memorable sartorial moments over the years.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Nicole Rivelli/2021 ViacomCBS, Inc.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While filming the last season, however, costume designer Jacqueline Demeterio faced a host of creative challenges. First, there was COVID. When production resumed last fall, the pandemic was still in what she calls "the scary part of COVID."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We started shooting in September and we were being tested every other day," Demeterio tells InStyle. "But we didn't know so much at that time. Things were just very scary. Cases would pop up in certain departments, and we'd have to shut down and quarantine."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it came to managing wardrobe, she took the approach of getting as many looks together at the beginning of the show and scheduling larger-than-usual fittings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I told all the actors, I want to do large fittings with you," she recalls. "Usually I can grab them and have numerous multiple fittings throughout filming. I didn't know how that was going to work, so I did these very large fittings and they were great."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Nicole Rivelli/2021 ViacomCBS, Inc.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another challenge for Demeterio in the final season was designing around Hilary Duff's growing baby bump. The actress, who plays Kelsey Peters, was pregnant with her third child at the time, and with COVID in the mix, there were frequent schedule and scene changes, which meant she was racing against time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Because obviously every week when you're pregnant, you're getting bigger and bigger," Demeterio says. "There'd be something she had already [worn] when her bump was small, but the scene wasn't shot out."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Weeks later, Demeterio and her team would have to jump into action — quickly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She'd text me from her camper and be like, 'Uh oh, this doesn't fit anymore,'" she recalls. "There was a lot of that happening. I had my tailor constantly putting in gusset on some sides of pants, adding panels, that sort of thing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the series comes to a close and the finale airing on June 10, we sat down with Demeterio to chat about big style moments from the final season and take a walk down Younger fashion memory lane.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hiding-hilarys-baby-bump></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Hiding Hilary's Baby Bump</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Nicole Rivelli/2021 ViacomCBS, Inc.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I had a lot of these dresses — these beautiful, flowy dresses that were Givenchy or Balenciaga — that had a lot of fabric and a lot of movement that seemed to work. That black and red one was from Balenciaga. I think she actually posted that when we were shooting on her Instagram. She's like, 'Jackie has now resorted to putting me in beautiful drapes or whatever.' I'm like, 'Well, you look beautiful.'"</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-finding-dianas-statement-necklaces></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Finding Diana's Statement Necklaces</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>ViacomCBS</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I found a lot of her jewelry at New York Vintage. Shannon, the owner, is a friend of mine. I would look online, on eBay, on 1stDibs. And there was this designer Iradj Moini. A lot of our necklaces came from him because he has those beautiful pieces. There's a store called Farajo — it's right next door to where Opening Ceremony used to be on Howard Street. He gets a lot of things in Asia, so I find pieces there. In Los Angeles, I would call my shoppers out there and they would hunt and send pictures. And sometimes Gucci had something in their new collection."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-making-maggie-really-shine></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Making Maggie Really Shine</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Nicole Rivelli/2021 ViacomCBS, Inc.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think we got to a place, especially this season, where it was like true Maggie Amato. We'd always wanted, and [Debi Mazer] did too, to get into that masculine feel where she's this artist from Brooklyn. There were a lot of those three-piece suits. And her hats and leather shirts and trousers — it was beautiful. The masculinity we were trying to achieve over seasons finally landed where we wanted it to. She wore a lot of Loewe this season because I felt like they were really hitting the note for Maggie. They had all these great high-waisted trousers and button-down shirts or blouses. Debi is great with headpieces like scarves. And she does her own hair and makeup — she's fabulous."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-establishing-joshs-girldad-style></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Establishing Josh's #GirlDad Style</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Nicole Rivelli/2021 ViacomCBS, Inc.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The character of Josh has always been sexy in his clothes.

Early on, she walks out of The Carlisle and she has that little white dress with the fringe. Then that moment with him when they confess their love for each other, she's in whites. At the airport with Quinn and Charles, there's a scene where Liza comes in. I had gotten a new white Gucci coat I wanted her to wear. It's this nod of innocence, especially next to Quinn, where Quinn is always in black or red. It's the angel/devil thing.

Starting her out at the beginning, when she was 28, she was using every trend and piling it on top of her on purpose. Because this is what she thought she should look like. She got more sophisticated throughout the series. This season, I've put her in some suiting, but with culottes instead of a regular trouser. There's a spin of Liza on it, but a more sophisticated Liza. She wears that gray culottes suit, and I put that Proenza Schouler orange under it to add a little quirk of Liza."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykuM6tn6Kml2TGsMHNoJyrZaSrerS0zrBknKejqcKusdJmnaKmkaF6tLHArKan</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./caroline-dries.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Caroline Dries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./naoya-inoue-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Naoya Inoue Wife, Family, Wiki, Net Worth, Height, Daughter</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-craig-and-paige-still-together-2023.html>Are Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo Still Together in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeffree-star-and-nathan-back-together.html>Are Jeffree Star and Nathan Back Together?
