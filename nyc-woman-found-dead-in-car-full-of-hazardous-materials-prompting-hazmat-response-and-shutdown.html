The body of the 35-year-old which was found in Manhattan, New York City, was reportedly surrounded by hazardous goods. Medical professionals confirmed the woman dead at the site.</p><p>Online sources state that three additional people, including two <a href=# rel>NYPD</a> officers and a first responder, are thought to have been impacted by the chemicals. The woman's car was parked outside an apartment building in Sutton Place. Emergency personnel, including a <a href=# rel>hazmat squad, were dispatched to the area</a> right away, reports <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Euroweeklynews</a></p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>AN AMERICAN EMERGENCY: East Palestine is being slowly murdered and it's time the country paid attention</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Matter of life and death': Ohio families asked to 'leave' as toxins swirl in air after controlled burning of derailed trains</a></p><h2 class=split>Shelter-in-place order placed</h2><p>Police claimed that they discovered liquid chemicals inside the vehicle, which is what they think killed the woman. "There was some assortment of liquid chemicals in the vehicle,' an NYPD spokeswoman said, as reported by<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> New York Post.</a>&nbsp; However, it is currently unclear what kind of chemicals they are. Hazmat-clad responders could be seen on the site. They looked to be carrying Geiger counters, which are devices used to detect radiation, as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">am NewYork Metro.</a> While the responders in white suits conducted their probe, the emergency services blocked off the nearby streets. According to reports, a shelter-in-place order has been given to nearby residents.</p><h2 class=split>'Smelled like a little bit of a science lab'</h2><p>A man who resides a block away told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CBS</a> that he smelled something. "I did smell something," Jake Steiner stated, adding, "It smelled like a little bit of a science lab. It's really scary to think about something so close to your neighborhood."</p><h2 class=split>'Officers hit by a potent sulfur smell'</h2><p>Two New York Police Department officers reportedly arrived at the site after another woman discovered the body while walking her dog, sources close to the investigation said, as per am NewYork Metro. The source claimed that when the officers unlocked the woman's car door, they were hit by a potent sulfur smell. After being checked on the spot, both of them are expected to be fine, the outlet's sources said. Although the police claimed to have found no evidence of illegal activity, it is still unknown whether the woman's death was an accident. "I have never seen anything like that," one officer told the publication, adding, "That is someone’s daughter." There have been no additional injuries reported at this time.</p><h2 class=split>Is this a chemical suicide?</h2><p>A man was similarly found in a vehicle in Queens almost four years ago. After an investigation, it was discovered that the man, a Lyft driver, had died by "chemical suicide," as stated by the police. The FDNY's HazMat Unit launched a massive response after the victim's body was found, clearing the area so that firefighters could remove the man's body from the car, reports <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Local Today. </a>According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, a chemical suicide is when a person dies after being exposed to chemical fumes from other products or household cleaners in a confined space.
