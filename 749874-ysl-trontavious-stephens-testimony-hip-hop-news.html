Opening statements in the case began in late November and saw the prosecution using a variety of different types of evidence to attempt to prove that YSL was a functioning gang in addition to a record label. In response, the prosecution did their best to pick apart evidence like transcripts from calls and song lyrics and reveal their original meanings, different from what the prosecution suggested.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A few weeks later though, the shocking news hit that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">one of Thugs' co-defendants in the trial was stabbed</a>. The jury was recessed a few days in advance of when they were originally scheduled to take a break for the holidays and the case returned earlier this week. In the meantime, Thug's legal team came through on a promise they made early in December. During the time off from the trial, they <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">filed a motion to dismiss</a> the case. The motion was heard as part of the proceedings that began earlier this week.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ysl-co-founder-on-the-stand>YSL Co-Founder On The Stand</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">But it seems like the flood of news from the YSL trial is about to start all over again. That started today when one of the co-founders of YSL Trontavious Stephens took the stand. More than a year ago Stephens took a plea deal to escape heading to trial in the major RICO case. But as part of his agreement he had to take the stand and testify, which got underway earlier today.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the comments of a post about him taking the stand, fans react. "oh na he definitely telling, he look old asl .. he ain’t got nothing to lose," one of the top comments reads. "he looked like he signed the YSL declaration of independence," another comment jokes. News on exactly what Stephens discussed while on the stand hasn't been reported yet. What do you think of the co-founder of YSL taking the stand in the RICO case against Young Thug?
