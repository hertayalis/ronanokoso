So he’s just pushing it off,” she says.</p><p>“Took matters into his own hands. I love it.”</p><p>The worker is soon accosted by several men and at least one woman as he points toward their boat.</p><p>After about three minutes, a shirtless man in gray shorts is seen lunging at the worker as he interacts with another man.</p><p>The assailant takes a swing at the worker, who flings his cap into the air as the crowd of onlookers continues shouting.</p><figure

stop the brawl.</p><p>Within seconds, several men are seen running to the scene and attacking the fallen worker.</p><p>One shirtless man also is seen punching another man in a blue shirt in the gut – apparently for intervening.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-style-default">A worker is seen talking to a man on the dock. <span

represent and no charges were filed against me because I was not involved,” he wrote in social media, according to the outlet.</p><p>However, several people disputed his account, including former Selma City Councilwoman Angela Benjamin, who accused him of being involved in the free-for-all.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-style-default">None
