At just 18 years old, Champion has been running circles around the blockbuster gauntlet since 2019, and given that he’s in for the long haul thanks to James Cameron’s Avatar franchise, we doubt he’s going to be slowing down any time soon.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>But where did this boy wonder come from exactly?

But, when Kevin accidentally summons a posse of witches known as The Three Mothers, he and Amber need to work together to survive the subsequent attack and somehow send the witches back to where they came from.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Avengers: Endgame (2019)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jack-champion-avengers-endgame.png><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>Following his debut in The Night Sitter, Champion made the one-in-a-million shot of jumping straight to Avengers: Endgame, one of the most culturally impactful blockbusters of our time.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>The young Champion loaned his talents for the iconic, illustrious role of Kid on Bike, a small boy on a bicycle who offers Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang a thousand-yard stare when he enquires what happened, having missed Infinity War‘s Thanos-related shenanigans due to being trapped in the Quantum Realm.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/avatar-the-way-of-water-2.jpg><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>Champion then went from blockbuster to blockbuster with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar: The Way of Water</a>, in which he portrayed Spider, the son of antagonist Miles Quaritch and close friend of Jake and Neytiri’s children, later being adopted into the family at the end of the film.</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>Champion will reprise his role in Avatar 3 and Avatar 4, which he filmed alongside Way of Water to ensure he didn’t age out of the role.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Scream VI (2023)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Group-shot-Scream-VI.jpg><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true>Champion’s latest appearance was in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scream VI</a>, where he filled the shoes of franchise newcomer Ethan Landry, the roommate of Scream V‘s Chad Meeks-Martin and arguably the number one Ghostface suspect. Champion once compared the filming of Scream VI to a “really fun summer vacation,” alluding to the intensity that came with his previous work on the Avatar franchise.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>What are Jack Champion’s upcoming movies?</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Avatar 3 (2024) and Avatar 4 (2026)</h3><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false>As mentioned earlier, Champion will be bringing Spider back for Avatar 3 and Avatar 4, having filmed his scenes during Way of Water‘s production to avoid the Stranger Things effect, so to speak.</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>It’s safe to assume that Spider will remain a steadfast ally of Jake and company, having been adopted into their family following the events of Way of Water.
