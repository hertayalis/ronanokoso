We‚Äôve got the lowdown on what she‚Äôs up to and whether she‚Äôs given up the underground race scene.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mallory Gulley (@mallory_gulley)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-happened-to-molly-on-street-outlaws>What happened to Molly on Street Outlaws?</h2><p>Molly never spoke out about why she no longer appears on Street Outlaws, but hasn‚Äôt appeared on the show since 2020. This doesn‚Äôt mean she has quit racing, but has been seen focusing on family, love and her home decor.</p><p>She got into a relationship towards the end of 2020, with Zach King, an ASU Alumni and fisherman. The couple had been posting pictures with each other since November of that year, and regularly went to sporting events together.</p><p>However, it looks like they may have split, as Molly has deleted all photos of them together except group images that he was pictured in. Looking at Zach‚Äôs <a href=#>Instagram</a>, there is no sign of the street racer on his page.</p><p>Since her exit, the star has been redecorating her home, which is described as Molly‚Äôs ‚ÄúBachelorette pad‚Äù by renovator Hope Gabriela Mitchell. This goes alongside working as a Bail Bond Agent at <a href=#>Gulley Bail Bonds</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-facebook wp-block-embed-facebook"><p>Mallory Gulley PT. 2! üíò‚ú®</p>Posted by <a href=# role=button>Hope Gabriela Mitchell</a> on&nbsp;<a href=#>Wednesday, January 26, 2022</a></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-discovery-her-racing-experience>Discovery: Her racing experience</h2><p>Molly was a firm favorite on Street Outlaws, and was known for driving the purple ‚ÄòUgly Duck‚Äô car. Part of team MSO, one of her last races on the show involved racing against Tricia Day, JJ Da Boss‚Äô wife.</p><p>She also went head-to-head with Milk Man, who only wanted to race against her if she took her nitrous bottle out of her vehicle. Molly is also known for winning a race against Gordon Batchelder.</p><p>It was back in June 2020 when Molly kept being picked to race, and was told by JJ Da Boss she was letting out the gas, which causes a burn-out. She has even driven in Zip Tie as well as her own vehicle Ugly Duck.</p><p>Tony Yeager was also one of Molly‚Äôs opponents, in a race involving a $1,000 side bet on Street Outlaws: Memphis.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Milk man is doing everything he can to get a win on Molly, and milk mom is out here lookin' for trouble.</p><p>Watch an all-new <a href=#>#StreetOutlaws</a>: Memphis tonight at 8p on <a href=#>@Discovery</a>. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/H6b0sIl2lB</a></p>‚Äî Street Outlaws (@StreetOutlaws) <a href=#>September 7, 2020</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-mallory-gulley-today>Where is Mallory Gulley today?</h2><p>Molly works for Gulley Bail Bonds, ran by her mom Cari Gulley and Kenneth, as well as KEG Towing. So realistically, she doesn‚Äôt have all that much time to be on the streets racing!</p><p>She also models merchandise for KEG Motorsports, which is ran by her father. A fan said they had spotted her, with Milk Man and Milk Mom at the racing event Arm Drop, in Bonne Terre, in June 2021, so she still appears to be racing.</p><p>Viewers say on a <a href=#>Reddit thread</a> that Molly has been attending college. Her <a href=#>Facebook page</a> states that she studied at Arkansas State University, and is living in Jonesboro, Arkansas ‚Äì over two hours from her usual Memphis race location.</p><p>She recently attended her younger sister‚Äôs wedding, where she revealed she took her two dogs as her dates. Several fans have took to her Instagram to ask why she no longer appears on Street Outlaws, but she has not responded.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mallory Gulley (@mallory_gulley)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p><strong>Reality Titbit has contacted Molly for comment.</strong></p><p><strong>Contact: Celine Byford ‚Äì <a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=294a4c4540474c074b504f465b4d694e5b5f07444c4d4048>[email&nbsp;protected]</a></strong></p><p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH STREET OUTLAWS MONDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHTS ON DISCOVERY AT 8 PM</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>INSTAGRAM</a> AND <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfrLWiwNJmpqdnnaS5rcWMppiyZZ6keq27zaCcq2WSmnqwuoysq6udlal6sMHTpZiwq12XwrV50qGcZqCRqLu1ecairZ6mXaq9br7AnKCnnw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./canelo-alvarez-bio-age-career-spouse-net-worth-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Canelo lvarez Bio, Age, Career, Spouse, Net Worth &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-toni-mahfud-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Toni Mahfud Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-craig-and-paige-still-together-2023.html>Are Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo Still Together in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeffree-star-and-nathan-back-together.html>Are Jeffree Star and Nathan Back Together?
