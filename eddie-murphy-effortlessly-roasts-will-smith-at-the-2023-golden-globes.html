The&nbsp;"Dolemite Is My Name" actor began his speech by looking back at his illustrious career and thanking those who've helped him along the way, including his girlfriend, Paige&nbsp;Butcher, and his 10 "amazing" children. "I've been in show business for 46 years, and I've been in the movie business for 41 years, so this has been a long time in the making and greatly appreciated," he said (via <a href=#>E! Online</a>). He then went on to share his advice for&nbsp;all the new up-and-coming artists in the industry. "I wanna let you know that there is a definitive blueprint that you can follow to achieve success, prosperity, longevity, and peace of mind," he said. The blueprint, he added, was simple: pay your taxes, mind your business, and — in a not-so-subtle reference to Will Smith's Oscars 2022 meltdown —&nbsp;"Keep Will Smith's wife's name out your f—ing mouth!"</p><p>The surprise joke drew cheers from the audience and was met with an overwhelmingly positive response online.&nbsp;On <a href=#>Twitter</a>,&nbsp;journalist Sylvia Obell said,&nbsp;"Eddie Murphy would be the only person to make a Will Smith joke that was actually funny." However, Murphy has since clarified his speech to <a href=#>ET</a>&nbsp;and said that Smith, his wife Jada, and Chris Rock are all his friends. "I've worked with Jada," he said. "I love Will. I love Will. And I love Chris&nbsp;— and it's all love."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlmaIB5go6em52hlWK6tr7PobBmnZabvLPAy56qrKSpYr%2BwrdKtqmavmaG5br%2FMoquhZZGperW0xGZpaWpjYrSwuMOepWafnKSvpr%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gretna-public-school-district-37.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gretna High School - Gretna</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./90-day-fiance-amira-just-confirmed-her-relationship-status.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Amira Just Confirmed Her Relationship Status</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-craig-and-paige-still-together-2023.html>Are Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo Still Together in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeffree-star-and-nathan-back-together.html>Are Jeffree Star and Nathan Back Together?
