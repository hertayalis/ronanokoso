The Radeon's FSAA works using a method called "supersampling," which happens to be the same method NVIDIA uses in their FSAA implementation. This method of FSAA basically takes the current game resolution and multiplies the horizontal and vertical resolutions by a factor, renders the scene at the higher resolution, and then scales the scene back down to the game resolution.</description></item><item><title>CPU Changes, Performance &amp;amp; Power Consumption</title><link>/apple-ipad-air-review.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/apple-ipad-air-review.html</guid><description>iPhone to iPad: CPU Changes Although the iPad Air uses the same A7 from the iPhone 5s (and M7 motion coprocessor), there are a few minor differences that do lead to better performance.
