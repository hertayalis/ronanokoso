Tinder recommends users try logging out and then back into their accounts to get their matches back, they can do this by selecting "settings" and then "logout."</p><p>Users should note though that if only one or two matches disappeared it's most likely because the other user they matched with either deleted their account or unmatched them.</p><p>Tinder did not immediately respond to Newsweek's request for comment.</p><p>This is a developing story and will be updated when more information becomes available.</p><span><i class=uncommon-logo></i></span><h2>Uncommon Knowledge</h2><p class=subtitle-desktop>Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.</p><p class=subtitle-mobile>Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.</p>");jQuery(this).remove()}) jQuery('.start-slider').owlCarousel({loop:!1,margin:10,nav:!0,items:1}).on('changed.owl.carousel',function(event){var currentItem=event.item.index;var totalItems=event.item.count;if(currentItem===0){jQuery('.owl-prev').addClass('disabled')}else{jQuery('.owl-prev').removeClass('disabled')} if(currentItem===totalItems-1){jQuery('.owl-next').addClass('disabled')}else{jQuery('.owl-next').removeClass('disabled')}})}})})<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrK6enZtjsLC5jq2gp5yVp3qurdOcn56rXaKytL%2FAoJysZZGlvW64zqyrZqafqXqtu8CdoKefXWZ%2FeX%2BYa2c%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ben-falcone-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ben Falcone Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./piper-curda-ethnicity-nationality-race-family-body-measurements-career-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Piper Curda Ethnicity, Nationality, Race, Family, Body measurements, career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-craig-and-paige-still-together-2023.html>Are Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo Still Together in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeffree-star-and-nathan-back-together.html>Are Jeffree Star and Nathan Back Together?
