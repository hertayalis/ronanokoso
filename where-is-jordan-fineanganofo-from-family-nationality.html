On Friday at approximately 5:30 a.m., paramedic Steven finished his shift and reclined in the rear of his ambulance parked in front of a Campbelltown McDonald’s on Queen Street.</p><p>Authorities claim that during Tougher’s meal break, Jordan forcibly opened the ambulance’s rear doors and repeatedly stabbed Tougher in the stomach.</p><p>In addition, the accused did not appear at the Parramatta Bail Court on Saturday morning because he was undergoing a psychiatric evaluation in relation to his murder charges.</p><p>During the brief court hearing, neither Fineanganofo nor his family were present. And his attorney, Javid Faiz, chose not to request bail, resulting in the formal denial of bail.</p><p>After the court proceedings, the attorney for the defendant, Faiz, who represented Sydney Criminal Law Specialists, stated that his client had experienced psychosis.</p><p>In addition, the accused murderer of the paramedic had previously received treatment at a mental health facility.</p><p class=toc_title>Page Contents</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Where is Jordan Fineanganofo?

In addition, we should contemplate the gravity of the crime committed by the 21-year-old and convey our condolences to the bereaved family, rather than searching for his nationality.</p><h2><span id=Jordan_Fineanganofo_Origin_And_Family>Jordan Fineanganofo Origin And Family</span></h2><p>There is little information available about the accused, Jordan’s parents. However, they are profoundly saddened and devastated by the fact that their son took the life of another person.</p><p>Toketa Fineanganofo, the father of Jordan, is devastated by the news and has conveyed his sorrow to the ailing family.</p><p>Toketa told the Sunday Telegraph, “We wish to express our deepest condolences to the family and for what has transpired.” We are out of words.”</p><p>All of his family members are in utter disbelief over what their son has done, and they have nothing to say other than their sorrow for the victim’s family.</p><p>Additionally, the perpetrator’s attorney, Faiz, stated that the accused is aware of his actions and their consequences and does not want parole.</p><p>Mr. Faiz stated, “I believe he had stopped treatment and medication at that time. He has psychosis-related concerns. Last night he was completely befuddled, but he is doing better today.”</p><p>In contrast, the paramedic family is utterly devastated, and Tougher’s newlywed wife and family have released a heartfelt statement.</p><p><strong>“Steven’s commitment to helping others shone brightest during his time as a NSW Ambulance paramedic and previously as a nurse,” they said.</strong></p><p><strong>“He was always ready with a smile, a kind word, or a helping hand, and he brought joy to those around him,” said his family.</strong></p><p>The Tougher family stated, “As we are still coming to terms with our loss, we request privacy at this time.”</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Personal Details, Career, And Wealth Of Gil Birmingham"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":37248,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://superstarsculture.com/personal-details-career-and-wealth-of-gil-birmingham/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/personal-details-career-and-wealth-of-gil-birmingham/"}{"1":65}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Personal Details, Career, And Wealth Of Gil Birmingham</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>murderer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Meet Amari Avery Parents Andre And Maria Avery: Family And Ethnicity</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Rina Sawayama | Racist Comments | Controversy</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rm6CoZpOkunDDx56pnmWZqHqru9GdmKdllp67pq3NoJinp5akeqe%2BzqZkn5mdnrm6ec2aq6Knnpa5qsDYaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-steelseries-arctis-pro-gaming-headset-lineup.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Arctis Pro Wireless - The SteelSeries Arctis Pro Gaming Headset Lineup: GameDAC Or Wireless</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./travis-fine-htm.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Travis Fine - Bio, Age, siblings, Wiki, Facts and Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-craig-and-paige-still-together-2023.html>Are Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo Still Together in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeffree-star-and-nathan-back-together.html>Are Jeffree Star and Nathan Back Together?
