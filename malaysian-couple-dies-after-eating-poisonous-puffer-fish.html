fish, of “fugu” in Japan, remain an enjoyed delicacy among upscale restaurants in Tokyo despite its high-toxicity risk.</p><p>Almost all puffer fish contain tetrodotoxin – a substance that is 1200 times more toxic than cyanide for humans, according to National Geographic.</p><p>Also known as blowfish, the toxic substance makes the species foul tasting to animals which also protects them from predators.</p><p>Qualified chefs who cook puffer fish are said to undergo at least three years of intensive training to learn how to remove the high concentration of toxins in its body.</p><p>These toxins are usually located in the fish’s internal organs, skin, blood and bones.</p><p>If ingested, symptoms of poisoning typically develop within 10 to 45 minutes of consumption and include numbness,
